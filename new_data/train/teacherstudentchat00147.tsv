Firstly the excessive cars that generate more gas can cause air pollution. So we need to call on people travelling by bus or subway. If you really need to drive a car, you can try an electric car. Secondly, there are a lot of plastic rubbish in the rivers and seas that can cause a large amount of fish to die. So we should avoid using plastic bags and do well in recycling. The plastic bags will still be there for a long period,  so we must collect them nowadays. By the way, we also need to create new types of bags which can not cause pollution. Thirdly, in my opinion, We can do two more essential measures to solve these pollution problems. One is trying to do rubbish classification, and the other is to learn environmental knowledge.   With these measures, I think our environmental problems will be getting better and better.	Yes, I think the problems with pollution and damage to the environment can be solved.
