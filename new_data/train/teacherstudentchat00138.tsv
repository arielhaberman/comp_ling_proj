It’s the same idea with having a good pension for employees in the public sector. Some of them are very well-paid like doctors and others are underpaid and overworked like nurses, teachers and firefighters. A huge number of people work in the private sector, and they can still receive a state pension as long as they pay their taxes and also a pension from their company. I think the working hours are a bit more regulated. Employers understand that they need to keep employees happy. If employees are always exhausted, they will soon burn out and leave. Some other social problems include poverty and the new problem that is access to healthcare. British healthcare system is excellent and free for everyone (paid through taxes), but it has been underfunded for a while and is getting overwhelmed at the moment.
