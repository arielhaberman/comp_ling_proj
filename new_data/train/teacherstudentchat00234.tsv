I think part of the issue is that we don't live in an age any more where whether you are working class or middle class is a very clear cut and obvious thing. Fifty years ago you could have told by someone's dress, address, and job title. now, not so much. Being 'working class' no longer means you're going down the pit each day, and being middle class no longer means having a house in the suburbs and going to work in a suit, so it's no surprise that class has become less solidly defined and more about self perception.

The reasons that middle class people would try to play up proletarian origins seem accurate. I'd also add that people adjust their own perception based on what others around them think. Class, after all, being a social concept. If you are someone who works in an environment where everyone seems more or less privileged than you have been, that changes your perception of your own origins. I felt very middle class at school, because I probably was compared to many kids I went to school with. When I went to university, everyone was middle class and many were positively posh. Then I went into a career where my own background, whilst undoubtedly middle class, was humble compared to many people I worked with. Of COURSE that changes your perception of what your own class background is.

Of COURSE that changes your perception of what your own class background is.					website
