First, when people work in the private sector, they have long working hours. And also they get paid well. But people who work in the public sector have relatively normal working hours and they do not get paid as much. Secondly, people who work in the public sector or private sector may have an inverse treatment regarding pension. So it's a difficult to select a company to work for in China.\nTeacher: \n\nStudent: It's a question to...\nTeacher: Thank you, great!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same idea with having a good pension for employees in the public sector. Some of them are very well-paid like doctors and others are underpaid and overworked like nurses, teachers and firefighters. A huge number of people work in the private sector, and they can still receive a state pension as long as they pay their taxes and also a pension from their company. I think the working hours are a bit more regulated. Employers understand that they need to keep employees happy. If employees are always exhausted, they will soon burn out and leave. Some other social problems include poverty and the new problem that is access to healthcare. British healthcare system is excellent and free for everyone (paid through taxes), but it has been underfunded for a while and is getting overwhelmed at the moment.", "original_response": "So,  yes, of course, the UK has lots of social problems, some of them similar to the ones in China and some quite different.
