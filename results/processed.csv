Do they sound the same in the UK?. Comment: Yes, they do. The pronunciation of ""schedule"" and ""school"" is the same in the UK as it is in the US.. Comment: Ah, I see! Thank you for clarifying!"
"Oh, really!? Is that like a dialect? I can understand the phonemic symbols.",But of course you can say them how you like <STUDENT>! (as in with an /r/ if you like - I'm just pointing it out for understanding! And Americans and many other English speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. Cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! I like the idea of you telling English peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most English people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral English accent - do you see?,"Oh, really!?

I'm not sure if the symbols are correct,ah  i see - a classic example! Yes good one! I guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? As in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word!,"I'm not sure if the symbols are correct, but here is the code for a simple password manager using JavaScript and local storage:. ```. // Function to generate a unique password. function generatePassword() {.   var password = """";.   var characters = ""ABCDEFGHI"
"Sorry, I cannot understand. What is the difference?",so if i say /skɒn/ (and i do!) an e.g. Scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are SCottish,"Sorry, I cannot understand. What is the difference?. Comment: The difference is that `a` is a variable, while `A` is a constant. In your example, `a` is assigned the value five, while `A` is not changed.. In general,"
"Oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as I don't know the background!",ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. Americans normally have an /r/ and most English people don't BUT the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing,"Oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as I don't know the background!

Can you put the verb in the right tense?,"yes, I still remember the problem and solution.. Thank you for bringing it up again. It's a good reminder of how far I've come since then!"
decrease,So you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! But what tense??,"decrease in the number of people who are overweight or obese..

"if we've got the exact date of this year, I think it's finished.",Ah well if we say e.g. twenty-fourth March two thousand and twenty then yes it;s finished BUT if we ONLY say 'this year' has it finished?,"if we've got the exact date of this year, I think it's finished.. I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling down, but I'm here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any other way I can help?"
or present continuous,OK good - so some time phrases AUTOMATICALLY need the past simple OR the present perfect OK? It depends on the phrase,or present continuous tense in english grammar..

OK! Thanks,"So,  yes, of course, the UK has lots of social problems, some of them similar to the ones in China and some quite different. It’s the same idea with having a good pension for employees in the public sector.

A huge number of people work in the private sector, and they can still receive a state pension as long as they pay their taxes and also a pension from their company. I think the working hours are a bit more regulated. Employers understand that they need to keep employees happy. If employees are always exhausted, they will soon burn out and leave. Some other social problems include poverty and the new problem that is access to healthcare. British healthcare system is excellent and free for everyone (paid through taxes), but it has been underfunded for a while and is getting overwhelmed at the moment.",OK! Thanks for letting me know!

Ok!,"English accent so posh man sounds foreign sixth November two thousand and twenty  A MAN’S accent has become so posh that it no longer sounds as if he is speaking the English language.  Julian Cook, who was born in Surrey, attended boarding school and now works for a London antiques auction house, has progressed beyond well-spoken to a dialect most people no longer recognise as English.  With the help of a translator, Cook said: “My mother always encouraged us to elongate our vowels as much as possible and not really move our mouths when we speak.  “For me, being almost incomprehensible is a sign of good breeding.”  While other posh people might occasionally slip in a ‘Diddy’ for ‘Daddy’ or say ‘baarth maart’ instead of ‘bath mat’, almost every word Cook says bears no resemblance to its written form.     He continued: “It also doesn’t help that my vocabulary is painfully obscure and I often can’t resist a foray into Latin when I’m doing something like buying a pint of milk at the corner shop.  “I’ve even encountered prejudice because people assume that I can’t possibly be English. Someone told me to go back to where I came from, which is a massive house in Richmond upon Thames.”","Ok! I'll give it a try..
