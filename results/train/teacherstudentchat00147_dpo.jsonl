Secondly, there are a lot of plastic rubbish in the rivers and seas that can cause a large amount of fish to die. So we should avoid using plastic bags and do well in recycling. The plastic bags will still be there for a long period,  so we must collect them nowadays. By the way, we also need to create new types of bags which can not cause pollution.
